Kafka on the Shore

This books is so good, strangely I felt connected somehow at many levels and with many characters at the same time!!! I usually read books related to science non fiction topics, so whenever I dare my self and take the opportunity to get out of my scientific comfort reading habitat and stumble onto books like these, it really blows my mind.

A part of me wishes that I hadn't read it yet so I could still read it for the first time and be mesmerized.

This book is possibly the best book I have read of all times. It has everything that anyone would want in a book because it is composed of a little of every genre. The book has so many symbolisms and imageries that no one can figure it all out in the first read.

In true Murakami style, where the plot isn¡¯t so much important but rather a green screen for the characters to perform. But something so surreal and fascinating, its like taking a dive into what you would think is azure water, only it is not.
